    <p><strong>Born:</strong> December 20, 1998, Bondy, France</p>

    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>Kylian Mbappé was born in Bondy, a suburb of Paris. His father, Wilfried, was his youth coach, and his mother, Fayza Lamari, was a professional handball player. Mbappé showed remarkable pace and technique from an early age and joined the Clairefontaine academy before moving to AS Monaco's youth system.</p>

    <h2>Club Career</h2>
    <p>Mbappé made his professional debut for AS Monaco at just 16 years old, quickly becoming one of Europe's most exciting prospects. He helped Monaco win Ligue 1 in the 2016–17 season and reached the Champions League semi-finals.</p>
    <p>In 2017, he joined Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), where he formed a star-studded attacking line with Neymar and later Lionel Messi. Despite dominating French football and winning multiple Ligue 1 titles, the club repeatedly fell short in the UEFA Champions League.</p>
    <p>In 2024, Mbappé left PSG to join Real Madrid — a dream move he had been linked with for years. Ironically, PSG won their first-ever Champions League title that same year, defeating Inter Milan in the final. Mbappé congratulated his former teammates but admitted the timing was "painful but motivating."</p>
    <p>At Real Madrid, Mbappé immediately made an impact, scoring in his debut and helping the club dominate La Liga. He is seen as the natural successor to Cristiano Ronaldo's legacy at the Bernabéu.</p>

    <h2>International Career</h2>
    <p>Mbappé debuted for the French national team in 2017 and was a key player in France’s 2018 World Cup-winning squad. At just 19, he scored four goals in the tournament — including one in the final against Croatia — becoming the youngest player to score in a World Cup final since Pelé.</p>
    <p>In the 2022 World Cup, Mbappé scored a hat-trick in the final against Argentina, becoming only the second player to do so in history. Despite France losing on penalties, he won the Golden Boot with 8 goals.</p>
    <p>Named France captain in 2023, he led the team to the Euro 2024 semi-finals. His leadership continues to grow, both on and off the pitch.</p>

    <h2>Personal Life</h2>
    <p>Mbappé is known for his charity work through his foundation “Inspired by KM.” He is also involved in major brand endorsements worldwide.</p>
